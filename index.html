    Just letting everyone know who opened up my first html website, this design came from Zach's challenge from the "Frontend Web Development Bootcamp Course (JavaScript, HTML, CSS)" by freeCodeCamp.com. I modified it to look and feel more personalized to me. Overall, I am pretty happy with the results.
